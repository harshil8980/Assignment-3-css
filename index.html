            <h2>Nutrational values</h2>
            <p>Kit Kat nutritional content might vary widely depending on the product and serving size. I can, however, give you a broad idea based on a regular Kit Kat bar.
                The estimated nutritional values for a normal 42g Kit Kat bar are:
                Approximately 210 calories
                11g total fat
                7g Saturated Fat
                5mg cholesterol
                30 milligrammes sodium
                27g total carbohydrate
                1g dietary fibre
                22g sugars
                3g protein
                Please keep in mind that these values are subject to change, and it's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the individual Kit Kat product you're using, since different varieties and sizes may have varying nutritional information.

                    Kit Kat ( stylized as KitKat in various countries) is a chocolate-covered wafer bar confection created by Rowntree's of York, United Kingdom, and is now produced globally by Nestl√© (which acquired Rowntree's in 1988),[1] except in the United States, where it is made under licence by the H. B. Reese Candy Company, a division of the Hershey Company (an agreement Rowntree's first made with Hershey in 1970).
                    The regular bars are made up of two or four pieces that are made up of three layers of wafer that are separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. Each finger can be removed from the bar individually. Kit Kat comes in a variety of tastes, including milk, white, and dark chocolate.
                    The original four-finger form of the bar was created when a worker at Rowntree's York factory suggested 'a chocolate bar that a man might take to work in his pack up' in the recommendation box. Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp first introduced in the United Kingdom in September 1935, and the subsequent two-finger version was introduced in 1936. In 1937, it was called Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp, and after WWII, it was simply Kit Kat.
